          <section aria-labelledby="overview">
						<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

						<p>In <em>Worlds Enough: The Invention of Realism in the Victorian Novel</em>, Elaine Freedgood speaks of realism as “the ur-form of the novel: the point of arrival and departure, the apex of representation that is also an endpoint, and a dead point.” For Freedgood, the Victorian novel, in particular, is “annexed to a larger nineteenth-century ‘realism’” that carries “a certain (imagined) stability of its representational world” understood in terms of both formal coherency and a tendency to be seen as “realistic in a good way” (ix, xi). As Freedgood notes, this sense of the Victorian novel’s authority and stability has largely been conferred by Western literary critical interventions of the 1970s and 1980s. But what of other critical contexts?</p>

						<p>This lesson plan introduces students to Chinese perspectives on Victorian novels to destabilize the received understanding of these texts as epistemologically and politically neutral. Chinese translations of Victorian texts became more accessible during the turn into the twentieth century thanks to the efforts of translators, such as Lin Shu (林紓), and opportunities to study abroad in countries like Japan, where there was better access to foreign books and translations. Following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty and a loss of faith in traditional Chinese sociopolitical power, many young Chinese political and literary writers of the early twentieth century would come to argue that reading and even producing Victorian novels – particularly Victorian realist novels – would lead to social and cultural benefits for Chinese reform. Following the Qing Empire’s collapse, student-led movements of the 1910s and 1920s would continue a demand for literary revolution, especially during the New Culture and later May Fourth Movement that followed protests against the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles on May 4, 1919. The Victorian novel played a crucial role in these debates – a role that has been apparent to Chinese literary scholars but not necessarily to Victorianists.</p>

						<p>The goal of this lesson plan is to produce debate and reassess assumptions about the centrality and representational authority of the Victorian novel through engaging Chinese contexts. Reading across literary fiction, essays, historical contexts, and literary critical work from Asian Studies, this module expands the geographical and temporal boundaries of Victorian Studies to, as Freedgood argues, “restore the full oddness of the nineteenth-century novel” (x).</p>

						<p>Overarching Questions:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>What are the historical contexts that prompted Chinese writers and thinkers to analyze Victorian realist perspective?</li>
							<li>How did Chinese writers understand and challenge concepts of realism?</li>
							<li>What happens to the Victorian novel in China?</li>
						</ol>
					</section>

          <section aria-labelledby="structure">
						<h3 id="structure">Structure and Organization</h3>

						<p>The materials selected are meant to serve educators and students of Victorian Studies as well as those of other fields such as Empire, World Literature, Asian Literature, and British Asian Studies. The lesson plan has been organized into four different clusters of materials: (a) “The Politics of Literary Genre”; (b) “Chinese ‘Victorian’ Narratives”; (c) “(Novel) Oddities,” and (d) “Outside Victorian Encounters.” Instructors are encouraged to engage with the clusters and/or individual suggested texts in whatever ways are most helpful for their pedagogical needs and goals.</p>

						<p>The first cluster on “The Politics of Literary Genre” provides a foundation for understanding the history of realism in English and Chinese contexts. This section would be useful to those who wish to teach the genre of the Victorian realist novel and/or to those who want to develop a better understanding of the history of the Victorian realist novel in China. Primary materials consist of nonfiction essays and autobiographical accounts by major Chinese political and literary writers of the 1910s that show conflicting arguments for how writing and reading Western realist novels could promote revolutionary change. Secondary sources provide instructors with background historical characters and events, including information on the New Culture movement and the repercussions of the 1919 student-led May Fourth Movement, both of which emphasized literature’s role in social reform.</p>
						
						<p>The second cluster on “Chinese ‘Victorian’ Narratives” introduces Chinese interpretations of Victorian narratives and would fit well in any class featuring work/s by Charles Dickens. Primary materials consist of the popular Chinese translator Lin Shu’s introductions to translations of Dickens’s novels as they situate a “Chinese” understanding of Victorian Britain and literature. Additional readings appended to this cluster construct narratives about China and Chinese people: a selection from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s conversations where he coins the term “world literature,” George Meredith’s satirical novel of English social problems, <em>The Egoist</em>, and a suggested secondary reading on <em>The Egoist </em>by Elizabeth Hope Chang that delineates the construction of Chineseness.</p>
						
						<p>The third and fourth clusters consist of works that look at the way Chinese writers diverged from traditions of Victorian literature. The third cluster on “(Novel) Oddities” takes on a world literature perspective to challenge a notion of the dominance of the Victorian novel as genre and form. The cluster consists of three surrealist works about societal madness – Lu Xun’s “A Madman’s Diary,” Nikolai Gogol’s “Diary of a Madman,” and Dickens’s brief “A Madman’s Manuscript” from <em>The Pickwick Papers</em> – by three authors notable for being “realist” writers. The secondary readings offer theoretical frames and practical approaches to reading against the realist grain in these experimental tales.</p>
						
						<p>The fourth and last cluster, “Outside Victorian Encounters,” consists of two works of Chinese modernist realism that express their own visions and critiques of fiction’s place in shaping a sense of one’s Chineseness. These texts also reflect on the place of Victorian fiction within a Chinese assessment of a longer British literary history.</p>
