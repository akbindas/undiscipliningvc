						<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

						<p>The nineteenth century saw an increasingly interconnected global economy reliant upon the often involuntary movement of people. The units in this lesson plan examine both forced and “free” migration and their implications for what we traditionally consider the field of Victorian Studies, with a focus on Chinese migration. Rather than treating China as a separate, distant entity, these units explore the interconnections between the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the “Victorian” world.</p>

						<p>It has become imperative today to reconsider the position of Asian and Asian American history and culture within the Victorian classroom – and it is particularly urgent in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and recent anti-Asian discourse and violence. Scholarship by Lisa Lowe and Edlie Wong, among others, contends that writings about Chinese migrants were integral to nineteenth-century debates about who could become a citizen in a liberal state. Discourses on Chinese migrant labor, slavery, abolition, and immigration intersected in often counterintuitive ways, as Chinese laborers were brought over from Guandong, often via Hong Kong, to the Caribbean and the American West. An attention to these intersections helps students analyze a “Victorian” world reliant upon mass migration and the connections between the Atlantic slave trade and the often forcible relocation of Chinese laborers.</p>
						
						<p>This lesson plan explores the interconnections between Chinese migration and other forms of migration and movement, working across the Pacific and Atlantic contexts. In doing so, it draws upon scholarship in Asian American Studies, Black Studies, China Studies, and Postcolonial Studies to interrogate the boundaries of Victorian Studies. Students will evaluate the contours of the category “Victorian” as well as the imbrication of genre, form, and material culture in the way we imagine migration and trade in the nineteenth century.</p>						
						
						<section aria-labelledby="central-questions">
							<h4>Central Questions</h4>
							
							<ol>
								<li>What is “Victorian,” and what is the field’s relationship to China Studies, Asian American Studies, Postcolonial Studies, and other related fields of study?</li>
								<li>In what ways did the global circulation of people and goods affect the development of literary, cultural, and artistic forms?</li>
								<li>What is the relationship between literature, genre, and political activism? How do genre and narrative enter into debates about migration, and how might they act unpredictably in the public sphere?</li>
							</ol>
						</section>

          <section aria-labelledby="structure">
						<h3 id="structure">Structure and Organization</h3>

						<p>The units in this lesson plan can be taught in order or in isolation. They begin with representations of China (both in discourse and objects), then move on to writings about Chinese migration, and finally end with contemporary writings. This series thus uses Chinese migration as a lens to survey methodological approaches to studying the “global” nineteenth century, ranging from Edward Said’s Orientalism and Elaine Freedgood’s thing theory to Olivia Loksing Moy’s “reading in the aftermath.” It is targeted more towards an advanced undergraduate student, but selected readings can be assigned to less advanced students.</p>

						<p>The introductory unit opens with Eric Hayot’s <em>The Hypothetical Mandarin: Sympathy, Modernity, and Chinese Pain</em> and the construction of China as the ultimate “other” in western writings from the Enlightenment onwards. It then redirects attention to Chinese objects, their global production and circulation, and their symbolic significance in everyday Victorian life. This section draws upon work by Freedgood and Elizabeth Hope Chang to analyze what Chang calls the “familiar exotic” in select nineteenth-century texts; then, students will consider the narratives constructed around actual nineteenth-century objects in a local or virtual museum. The following units examine constructions of the individual subject and Chinese migration as well as the composite genres and forms that were shaped by these debates. The final unit considers the ongoing “aesthetic afterlife” of nineteenth-century British Orientalism and approaches to complicating that afterlife, whether through historical fiction or literary criticism.</p>

									<li>According to Chang, how does the Chinese collection referenced in Dickens and Horne’s essay impose “a structuring and guiding British vision” (117)?</li>
									<li>Describe Freedgood’s approach to analyzing objects in Victorian novels. Why are objects so important to Freedgood's understanding of <em>Jane Eyre</em>? How might Freedgood’s approach change our understanding of the <em>Household Words</em> essay?</li>

								<ol>
									<li>Harte originally wrote “Plain Language from Truthful James” (popularly known as “The Heathen Chinee”) to satirize anti-Chinese prejudice in California in the 1870s. In the poem, the narrator “Truthful James” and his friend Bill Nye play a card game, called euchre, with Ah Sin. Bill Nye tries to cheat by hiding cards up his sleeves, but Ah Sin is the better cheater and wins the game. In anger, Bill Nye attacks Ah Sin.<br />
									Why do you think this poem is called, “Plain Language from Truthful James”? What is the narrator’s attitude toward the story he is telling? What is the role of satire in this poem? Provide a few specific examples from the text.</li>
									<li>How is Chun Young Hing’s “story” presented by Wong Chin Foo? Based on your own analysis and secondary reading by Edlie Wong, consider how Wong Chin Foo draws upon slave narratives and other generic conventions in his representation of Chun Young Hing’s sufferings to an American readership.</li>
									<li>Compare and contrast the use of narrative, irony, and tone in Harte’s poem and Wong Chin Foo’s writings. Why do you think Harte’s satirical poem became so important to the Chinese exclusion movement?</li>

						<p>Jessica R. Valdez is a lecturer in literature of the long global nineteenth century at the University of East Anglia. She is currently working on a book manuscript tentatively called, <em>Despots and Democrats: China and America in British Literature, 1834-1901</em>. Her first monograph, <em>Plotting the News in Victorian Literature </em>(EUP 2020), analyzes competing understandings of national identity in nineteenth-century novels and the newspaper press. <em>Plotting the News</em> demonstrates that Victorian novelists functioned as early media theorists as they thought through the overlapping systems of reality offered by newspapers and novels. She previously worked at the University of Hong Kong.</p>
